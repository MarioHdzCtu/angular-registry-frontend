#Use this if you are using a PAAS platform (As dokploy) that uses its own reverse proxy

# Stage 1: Build the Angular application
FROM node:20-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
# Run the build command
RUN npm run build -- --output-path=./dist --configuration=production

# Stage 2: Serve the static files (NO NGINX)
# Use a simple, lightweight web server like Caddy or even a simple Express server
# OR, the best approach for Dokploy:
FROM alpine:latest
# Choose a lightweight http server if necessary, or just rely on Dokploy's config
# For simplicity, let's assume Dokploy expects the files to be in a certain path or uses its own light server.
# For most deployment systems, you just need the files and let the platform serve them.
# If Dokploy needs a specific internal path for static files, adjust this.
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html # A common path structure
COPY --from=builder /app/dist/browser .
